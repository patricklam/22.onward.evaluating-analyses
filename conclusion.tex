\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we presented a principled approach for thinking about
evaluations of program transformation tools. After identifying
a set of benchmarks and a set of evaluators, one can pose questions
to the evaluators about the usefulness of the tool's output on the benchmarks.
We presented a case study---our JTestParametrizer program transformation tool---and
supplemented it with other examples of evaluations from the literature.
We hope to spark a discussion in the community about how to
productively evaluate this kind of tool, which we believe to be an
important application of program analysis techniques.
